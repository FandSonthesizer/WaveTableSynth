# WaveTableSynth
This is a wavetable synth based on out Essential Shield project. It got midi, multiple voices, fm voices, ADSR and so on.
Based on the STM32 'Blue Pill' one can build this nice little gadget for less than 50â‚¬!

We added a 24dB VCF based on a Ray Wilson design (MusicFromOuterSpace) and got really good results. The VCF project is also included here.

Have fun building this project and even more fun to putting it to good use.
