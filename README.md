# WaveTableSynth
This is a wavetable synth with midi, multiple voices, fm voices, ADSR and so on.
Based on the STM32 'Blue Pill' one can build this nice little gadget for less than 50â‚¬!

We added a VCF based on a Ray Wilson design (MusicFromOuterSpace) and got really good results.

Have fun building this project and even more fun to putting it to good use.
